# The_Red_Spring  
The Red Spring is a short text-based mystery game written and developed over the course of seven days.  
Taking inspiration from the works of H.P. Lovecraft; The Red Spring welcomes the player into the town of Redspring, where the player - taking on the role of one of the three selectable protagonists - has been invited by the town's mayor to investigate a series of disappearances.
Through a D20 based probability system, the player will take on interactions, physical challenges, and investigations - each with differing probabilities to succeed or fail to differing levels - with each protagonist excelling at different areas of investigation; this encourages the player to lean into the strengths of their selected protagonist as they explore Redspring.
That said, the investigation is not without risk, and as much as excelling in the tasks can unveil the great secrets of Redspring, Non-Player-Characters remember previous interactions, and stark enough failures can lead to death.
Now, equipped with the knowledge you now possess, enter The Red Spring, unveil the dark secrets within, and, as always... Don't be a Stranger!
